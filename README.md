# hangman
one file, two versions of hangman, and a huge list of words.

If you'd like to play hangman, or better yet hangman with hints, I recommend you check out this repo.

## Inside I've provided two versions of hangman
- Hangman
- Hangman with hints

### Hangman
This version of hangman plays like any normie version of hangman you've probably played in class

### Hangman with hints
This version of hangman provides helper functions that will show you possible matches to the word you've guessed so far

## Dependencies
There are none for this specific project

## Notes
Make sure you include the provided words.txt file or one of your own, otherwise the progam will not work
